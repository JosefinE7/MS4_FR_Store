# FutureRetro

FutureRetro is a website created for an up-and-coming designer named Erika Johnsson. 
Erika’s design aesthetic is balancing the nostalgia of 1940-1950s clothing while remaining 
modern and fresh, handmaking each item and gathering materials and fabric for these items
through secondhand stores to minimize her environmental impact. The FutureRetro store has 
up until now been managed through social media interactions such as Instagram DM’s as 
well as more locally through word of mouth. Erica is starting to realize the potential
of the FutureRetro brand because it taps into an ever-emerging ‘green market’ that is
rapidly growing in popularity and demand. 

Erika’s business is booming and it is hard for Erika to keep up with orders coming in
since most of her sales happen through comments and DM’s. Erica is scared that she will 
accidentally forget or miss messages and by extension a sale. She has therefore ordered 
a website where she can manage all her sales safely as well as properly display all of 
her products to new and revisting customers.

The FutureRetro customer is an environmentally conscious modern-day woman who wants
the classic and feminine silhouette of the 1940s-1950s while remaining modern. The 
FutureRetro customer tends to purchase clothing that has a more modest/conservative 
feel but all items can be integrated into every woman’s closet because of its timeless design.

### Design Choices
The styling of the page is inspired by the vintage 1940-1950s design of the 
FutureRetro brand. With a typewriter font and squared buttons, the aim was 
to give a bit of old newspaper aesthetic but without it looking old or like 
a caricature. 

**Fonts**

Everything about the website was intended to match the vintage aesthetic of
the brand. That of course includes the font. The font ‘Special Elite’ was 
chosen to give the website a vintage typewriter look. 

**Icons**

There are a couple of icons used across the FutureRetro website, mainly for 
the navigation links in the top right corner of the website. The Font Awesome
‘user’ icon representing personal account-related pages, the ‘heart’ icon 
representing the Like page, and the ‘shopping-bag’ icon to represent the bag page.

**Colors**

The colors of the page are in line with the vintage aesthetic of the rest of 
the page taking inspiration from black and white photos as well as old newspapers. 
The black and white colors are also used to really make the product photos, which 
are in color, pop off the page. The page colors, although seemingly simplistic was 
very much a conscious choice. 

**Product Images**

All product images of the page are in color, although having black and white images was
something I initially considered it was quickly ruled out on the basis of impracticality. 
The customers need to be able to properly view what the product looks like to be able to 
envision what it is going to look like on them. In terms of the actual pictures, I wanted
to find images that looked more ‘natural’ and not with the 
‘photo-studio-white-backdrop-product’ type of look. This was pretty hard to find, but I 
saw a recommendation on Slack about a website called Unsplash where I was able to find 
pictures in the line of what I was looking for. If this was a real website my thinking was 
that the images for the website would be taken in a sewing or art studio environment to give
the impression of a homemade and cozy aesthetic.  

### Wireframes

The wireframes I created for this project were all made in Balsamiq Wireframes and each link 
represents different screen sizes and parts of the website. 

I would like to deeply apologize about the size of these wireframes when looking at them on my 
GitHub repository. This is something I noticed when linking them to my README and by that time 
it was too late and I simply didn’t have enough time for resizing. I will not make this mistake 
again in future projects.
