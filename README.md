# FutureRetro

FutureRetro is a website created for an up-and-coming designer named Erika Johnsson. 
Erika’s design aesthetic is balancing the nostalgia of 1940-1950s clothing while remaining 
modern and fresh, handmaking each item and gathering materials and fabric for these items
through secondhand stores to minimize her environmental impact. The FutureRetro store has 
up until now been managed through social media interactions such as Instagram DM’s as 
well as more locally through word of mouth. Erica is starting to realize the potential
of the FutureRetro brand because it taps into an ever-emerging ‘green market’ that is
rapidly growing in popularity and demand. 

Erika’s business is booming and it is hard for Erika to keep up with orders coming in
since most of her sales happen through comments and DM’s. Erica is scared that she will 
accidentally forget or miss messages and by extension a sale. She has therefore ordered 
a website where she can manage all her sales safely as well as properly display all of 
her products to new and revisting customers.

The FutureRetro customer is an environmentally conscious modern-day woman who wants
the classic and feminine silhouette of the 1940s-1950s while remaining modern. The 
FutureRetro customer tends to purchase clothing that has a more modest/conservative 
feel but all items can be integrated into every woman’s closet because of its timeless design.


## UX

### Design Choices
The styling of the page is inspired by the vintage 1940-1950s design of the 
FutureRetro brand. With a typewriter font and squared buttons, the aim was 
to give a bit of old newspaper aesthetic but without it looking old or like 
a caricature. 

**Fonts**

Everything about the website was intended to match the vintage aesthetic of
the brand. That of course includes the font. The font ‘Special Elite’ was 
chosen to give the website a vintage typewriter look. 

**Icons**

There are a couple of icons used across the FutureRetro website, mainly for 
the navigation links in the top right corner of the website. The Font Awesome
‘user’ icon representing personal account-related pages, the ‘heart’ icon 
representing the Like page, and the ‘shopping-bag’ icon to represent the bag page.

**Colors**

The colors of the page are in line with the vintage aesthetic of the rest of 
the page taking inspiration from black and white photos as well as old newspapers. 
The black and white colors are also used to really make the product photos, which 
are in color, pop off the page. The page colors, although seemingly simplistic was 
very much a conscious choice. 

**Product Images**

All product images of the page are in color, although having black and white images was
something I initially considered it was quickly ruled out on the basis of impracticality. 
The customers need to be able to properly view what the product looks like to be able to 
envision what it is going to look like on them. In terms of the actual pictures, I wanted
to find images that looked more ‘natural’ and not with the 
‘photo-studio-white-backdrop-product’ type of look. This was pretty hard to find, but I 
saw a recommendation on Slack about a website called Unsplash where I was able to find 
pictures in the line of what I was looking for. If this was a real website my thinking was 
that the images for the website would be taken in a sewing or art studio environment to give
the impression of a homemade and cozy aesthetic.  

### Wireframes

The wireframes I created for this project were all made in Balsamiq Wireframes and each link 
represents different screen sizes and parts of the website. 

I would like to deeply apologize about the size of these wireframes when looking at them on my 
GitHub repository. This is something I noticed when linking them to my README and by that time 
it was too late and I simply didn’t have enough time for resizing. I will not make this mistake 
again in future projects.

## Features

### Existing Features
The FutureRetro project has several different features across several different pages. I will go through the project 
page by page to the best of my abilities. For convenience I am starting with the header/navigation elements at the top 
of the page, then the home page and moving across the project from there. The whole FutureRetro project is styled using 
Bootstrap classes to adjust to different screen sizes.The whole project is heavily inspired by the Boutique Ado project 
from Code Institute both in terms of structure and functionality.

#### Navigation Element
* FutureRetro logo link - left upper corner, is used to navigate the user back to the home page when clicked. 
Displayed in the left dropdown menu when on medium and small screens.

* Search bar - middle of upper navbar, makes it possible for the user to find what it is they are looking for 
instantly by searching item name or description. Displayed in the left dropdown menu when on medium and small 
screens.

* My Account - displayed by ‘user’ icon on right side of screen, allows the user to navigate to profile 
connected pages such as: ‘login’, ‘register’, ‘profile page’, ‘log out’ and if logged in as admin 
‘product management’. 

* Like page - displayed by ‘heart’ icon on the right side of screen, allows the user to navigate to the template 
that displays the users liked items. 

* Bag page - displayed by the ‘shopping bag’ icon on the right side of screen, allows the user to navigate to 
the shopping bag template of the page.

* Various clothing, jewelry, deals and about navigation bar- located underneath the main navbar items on large 
and extra large screen sizes and in the left dropdown menu on medium to small screen sizes. Gives the shopper 
the ability to easily maneuver between different item categories on the page.
   * All products dropdown- displays 3 category options to the user. Displaying all products, by price or by 
   category. 
   * Clothing dropdown- displays 5 clothing category options to the user: dresses, blouses, skirts and jackets
    as well as an all clothing category which displays a version of the products page with the items requested
    when clicked. 
   * Jewelry dropdown- displays 4 jewelry category options to the user: necklaces, earrings and bracelets as 
   well as an all jewelry category which all display a version of the products page with the items requested 
   when clicked.
   * Specials dropdown- displays 3 category options to the user: new arrivals and clearance as well as an all 
   specials category which all display a version of the products page with the items requested when clicked.
   * About page anchor - takes the user to the FutureRetro about page where the user can find more information 
   about the FutureRetro brand and practices. 

#### Home page:
* Hero image and ‘Shop Now’ anchor - located at the very top of page, 100% in screen height containing an 
hero image as well as a ‘Shop Now’ anchor styled as a button taking the shopper to the ‘All products’ page.

* About text - located underneath the hero image, giving the visitor more insight into FutureRetro as a brand
 as well as a link to the about page. 

* New Releases OWL Carousel - located underneath about text section, containing card elements displaying 
the FutureRetro New Releases, the amount of cards viewed at once differing depending on screen size. 

* Juicer Instagram extension - at the bottom of the page, containing an Instagram extension that allows 
the visitor to see FutureRetro Instagram posts as well as visit them directly. 

#### Products pages
* Products - when clicking any of the item categories on the page the user gets taken to a version of 
the product page that shows items in card form with image, name, price and category displayed. Clicking 
on the item card element takes the user to the products detail page. 

* Product detail - displays the item clicked on the product page with: image, name, price, rating, category,
 description, like button, a dropdown menu for sizes(if the item has sizes), increment quantity option, add 
 to bag button and a keep shopping button. When clicking the image the product image is displayed in a 
 seperate tab. Underneath the product details there is an option for signed in users to rate and comment 
 on the item. These comments will be displayed at the bottom of the screen and the average of all ratings 
 will show under product category.     

#### Personal pages

All personal pages are supplied by Allauth.

* Login page - consists of a simple login form requesting user username or email as well as a password, with an 
option for this information to be saved for future visits with the remember me checkbox as well as two buttons 
navigating the user either through the log in process or back to the home page. Above the form is a link to the 
register page for new visitors.

* Register page - consists of a little more of an extensive form asking the new user to supply: email, username 
and password. The email and password fields are repeated to ensure that the right information is supplied. Below 
the form are two buttons navigating the user either through the register process or back to the home page. Above 
the form is a link to the for revisiting member to direct them to login page.

* My Profile page - has two main sections. First a form with  default delivery information which can be filled 
in on the My Profile page or been saved earlier while making a previous purchase, second a list of the users 
order history allowing the user to look over all purchase information from previous orders. On the My Profile
 page only a couple key order details  are mentioned, but when clicking the order number the user is taken to
  the full copy of the order.

#### Item saving and purchase pages

* Likes page - displays all liked items in similar card form as the product page complete with image, name, 
price and category with a add to bag button that takes the user to the product detail view. 

* Bag page - displays all items that have been previously added to the shopping bag by the user. Items are 
presented horizontally with image, name, SKU, price with quantity and size options as well as remove item 
options. At the bottom of the page are all prices associated with the upcoming purchase such as item total, 
delivery cost and grand total with a button taking the customer to the official checkout page. 

* Checkout page - can only be reached by clicking ‘Secure checkout’ button and takes user to a page split 
in to two sections. On the right side of the screen or alternatively at the top the form in the small 
screen there is a order summary displaying the bag item pictures, names, size, price as well as bag total 
to give the shopper one last possibility to look through the purchase before completing it. The other 
section is a form element requesting the customers delivery information: name, email, phone number, street 
address, town or city, county, postal code and country. If the customer is logged in there is a checkbox 
for the user to save their information and if the customer is not logged in there is a link to the 
login/register page. Underneath the delivery form is a Stripe element that handles all purchases. 
Underneath the Stripe object there are two buttons: one giving the shopper the ability to go back to 
the bag as well as a ‘Complete order’ button to complete the order.

* Checkout success - is where the customer lands after completing a purchase. At the top of the page
 is a message thanking the customer as well as letting them know that the confirmation listed below 
 has also been sent to the email provided. The confirmation contains a full description of the purchase:
  order- number, date, item names, item prices, item sizes and all the personal delivering information 
  supplied by the customer during purchase as well as all costs related to purchase.   
 
#### Admin
* Product Management - In this template a page admin can add, adjust and remove items directly on the website.
 When adding new products this page is accessed in the top navbar, when adjusting particular items the page 
 is reached by clicking update in the product detail template. On the actual page there are a form with 
 fields requesting information about the product such as product category, name, sku, description, size 
 availability, price, image url and image file  

* Admin interface - is reached by visiting the /admin page. After logging in with an admin login the admin 
can here review all important information connected to every individual django app in the store such as 
Emails, Users, Orders, Categories and Products. Providing the admin with all information necessary to run 
the website.   

### Features Left to Implement

For this project I initially had plenty of extra features I wanted to add to my project, unfortunately 
I made some coding decisions that were not as time efficient as I would have wished. More information 
about this is the acknowledgment section at the end of the page. 

Here are the pages I hope to update my project with:

* Allauth social media features - The main idea of this website is being able to use social media to grow 
as a brand. I am therefore looking to add the Allauth feature where customers can login using their social 
media accounts. This way the customer is more likely to join as a member because you remove the process of 
having to sign up, you also give the customer the ability so use paying options like Google wallet to 
streamline the shopping process. 

* Right now items have to be manually put into the ‘New Releases’ category. I want to add a functionality 
that automatically transfers items in and out of this category, so items added within the last 30 days will 
automatically be added to the ‘New Releases' category and will subsequently be taken out and added to the
 item category by the end of those initial 30 days.

* Right now the sizes of products with sizes are simply put as letters, although this looks presentable 
on the front end and technically may work for a smaller store it is not good practice and it makes it 
harder in terms of overview purposes. I would like to update this feature as soon as possible to create 
a better and more organized site owner experience.   

* Giving the logged in user the ability to remove likes from their likes page, this feature was cut purely 
because of time restraints.

### Bugs
**Emails**

The far biggest and strangest bug in my project regards the emails. Before connecting my project to the gmail application I would already receive emails from my project, specifically order confirmations. I thought this was strange but I decided to ignore it and try implementing the proper gmail functionality according to the Code Institute videos. When I did I stopped receiving the emails I had previously received and I also didn’t receive any new ones. I tried going over the video several times, and comparing my code through a third party code comparing website that had been recommended to me by a tutor on an earlier occasion. I couldn’t find anything wrong with the code and I made sure my keys and values were correct in the Config Vars in my Heroku app but I couldn’t find anything. Because of time restraints I decided to go back to the email code from before the Set Up Emails video to at least guarantee order confirmation emails. 
When I had a closer look at the confirmation emails sent my way, all the order information was correct but the strange thing is the email comes in the form of Boutique Ado email. Not the emails that are added in my email confirmation section. I looked over my code again to try to find where all of this code was coming from but I could not and can not find it. I looked over my entire checkout app but could not find where the code is coming from.

**Allauth buttons** 

When having check-ins with my mentor I could see that whenever he would screen share some of the Allauth buttons would have basic and grey styling. I have tried looking for this same bug in Google Chrome as well as FireFox but can not figure out where it is originating from. When visiting the sites I get the proper styling on both browsers. 

**FireFox**

When in Firefox the proper text styling does not show up in the country dropdown bar, insted the styling is Times New Roman. 

In FireFox small up and down buttons are on top of the quantity selector and I have not figured out how to get rid of this.  

The third thing I noticed that is different about my project when I visit it in FireFox is the fact that the back-to-top button on the site completely disappears in FireFox.

I am excited to truly start experimenting with a lot more different browsers when working on a project, this is the first time when I have truly realised how many differences there can actually be between them in terms of displaying code. 


## Deployment
Cloning the MS4_FR_Store to GitHub Desktop using Windows Explorer: 
To deploy this page to your own GitHub Pages navigate to my [Github Repositiy, you can find it by clicking here](https://github.com/JosefinE7/MS4_FR_Store), below is a step by step process allowing you to clone the project and make it your own. 
1. Before you start make sure to sign in to GitHub or GitHub Desktop before you begin the process of cloning the project.
1. On the GitHub website navigate to the [MS4_FR_Store](https://github.com/JosefinE7/MS4_FR_Store) on my GitHub profile JosefinE7.
1. In the top right corner above all the files in the repository click the green Code button.
1. Pick the Open with GitHub Desktop option to clone and open the repository with GitHub Desktop.
1. Next to the header Local Path there will be a Choose… button. This allows you to choose a local path where you want to clone the repository to.
1. After this click the ‘Clone’ button.
1. You should now have a cloned version of my project in your desired location.

You can also clone the project directly in the command line, you do this by: 
1. Navigation to my repository   [MS4_FR_Store](https://github.com/JosefinE7/MS4_FR_Store) on my GitHub profile JosefinE7.
1. In the top right corner above all the files in the repository click the green Code button.
1. From here on there are a couple of different options. To clone the repository using HTTPS: make sure you are set on the HTTPS option and then click the small clipboard icon button. If you wish to use SSH or GitHub CLI simply pick either of these options instead and then click that same small clipboard icon button. 
1. Start up and log into your own repository where you wish to work on the project.
1. Write git clone in the terminal and then paste in the URL you copied from my repository earlier and then press Enter to create a clone of my project.
I got this information on GitHub so for more information visit [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop)

Additionally you have to add a couple of secret variables to your gitpod settings, alternatively set/export them in your terminal. These variables are: 
- SECRET_KEY: this can be any password but I recommend using a [Django Secret Key Generator](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/) to keep your project nice and safe.
- STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY:
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY:
- STRIPE_WH_SECRET:
To get the Stripe keys you need to create your own Stipe account. 
1. Go to the [Stripe Register website](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).
1. Sign up by using your email, full name as well as supplying a password and setting your country. Finish by clicking ‘Create your Stripe account’
1. Then head to the email provider you signed up with and click ‘ Confirm Email Address’ in the confirm email you received from Stripe.
1. You will be taken back to the Stripe page to confirm your password one more time and then click continue, you will be presented with a checkbox making you confirm you are not a robot. Doing this you will be taken directly to the Stripe dashboard.
1. Click the ‘Get your API keys’ tab and you should see both a ‘Publishable key’ and a ‘Secret key’.
1. Copy the Publishable key and go to back to your workspace.
1. If using OSX or  Linux operating systems write: ‘export STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXX’ in the terminal (the XXX being the key you just copied from Stripe) and click enter.
1. If using Windows write: ‘set STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXX’ in the terminal (the XXX being the key you just copied from Stripe) and click enter.
1. Now go back to the Stipe website and copy the secret key and repeat the same process in the terminal but insted ‘set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=XXXXXXXXX’ or ‘export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=XXXXXXXXX’ and click enter.
1. Now launch your website to the server and copy the URL for your website opened in the browser.
1. After this go back to Stripe.
1. On the left side navigation element click Developers.
1. Then click Webhooks.
1. In the right corner click Add endpoint.
1. Paste your url in ‘Endpoint URL’ field adding a ‘checkout/wh/’ at the end of your url, write a description if you like 
1. Click Receive all events and then click add.
1. You will now see a Signing secret header and a click to reveal button 
1. Copy the signing secret and go back to your workspace terminal 
1. Write ‘set STRIPE_WH_SECRET=XXXXXXXXX’ or ‘export STRIPE_WH_SECRET=XXXXXXXXX’ and click enter
After this you are all ready to go in your git workspace, to deploy to Heroku there are a couple or more steps needed since you need somewhere to store static files so let's go through that now. 

#### Deploying to Heroku:
setting up account to Heroku:
1. To start deploying your project go to: [Heroku](www.heroku.com) . 
1. To sign up for a new accountI provided my first name, last name, email, country as well as selecting Python as Primary development language. 
1. Before clicking the Create Free Account button you have to pass a CAPTCHA. 
1. After clicking the submit button Heroku sends a confirmation email to the email provided in the form, go to your email and confirm this email following the instructions given to you. 
1. In the email there is a confirmation link, when clicking the link you are able to decide your password as well as confirm it an extra time before clicking the “Set password and log in” button right underneath the password form. 
1. After setting up your password you will be taken to a page that says Click here to proceed, clicking the button takes you to your app dashboard. 
 
Creating a Heroku app:
1. Now when your account is set up you will be arriving on the Heroku dashboard. There will be a couple of different languages presented.
1. Below the languages there is a button that says: Create new app, click this button. 
1. You will be taken to a form where you give the app a name, the name has to be unique, in lowercase  and use dashes(-) instead of spaces.
1. Then choose the region closest to you, the options provided are the United States or Europe. 
1. Then click the Create App button at the bottom of the form. From there you are brought to a new dashboard where you are presented with different options to connect the app. 

Connecting the app: 
1. First click the Resources tab
1. Search for the Postgres and click the Heroku Postgres option
1. Select the option free plan and click Provision
1. We will get back to this but first in the Heroku main tab click Deploy.
1. You can use the Heroku CLI for which there are instructions provided close at the top of the page but I personally recommend using Automatic Deployment insead, this option allows you to push changes directly from your GitHub repository  
1. So in the Deployment method section click the GitHub option, 
1. In the ‘search for repository to connect to’ put in your GitHub username, then in the add your repository name in the “repo-name” search bar. 
1. When you have written your repository name click the Search button. 
1. After clicking the button your repository should be listed below, click the “Connect to this app” button to connect. 
1. Your GitHub repository should now be connected
Dealing with hidden files and deploying to Heroku: 
1. Before you can click the button to enable Automatic Deploys in the section below, you have to deal with same secret variables that we exported in our terminal above. These secret variables need to be added manually. 
1. You take care of this by clicking the Settings tab for your app, and then click on the Reveal Config Variables in the Config Vars of the page. By clicking the Reveal Config Variables you can securely provide Heroku with the variables that are required.
1. The Postgres variable is already there and you can leave that be
1. Add the same Stripe variables as listed above: SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY and STRIPE_SECRET_KEY. All with the accompanying values. 
1. After this you need to find a place to store your static files so it is time to start connecting to Amazon web services. 
 
#### Setting up AWS account:
1. Start by navigating to [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/) .
1. Click on create a AWS account in the top right corner.
1. Fill in email, password and account name then click continue.
1. On the account type page select personal and fill in the rest of the required information, check the required box and then click continue. 
1. You will be asked to supply a credit card number, this is used if you go over the free limit  threshold. You will not go over the limit with this project but be sure to check out further information in case you are planning on using this account for future projects. 
1. After clicking verify and add, AWS requires a captcha test.
1. When you have confirmed all necessary information go back to aws.amazon.com and access the login through the AWS Management Console under My Account

#### Setting up S3 
1. Once signed in you will see a search bar, search: S3.
1. In S3 you will create a bucket, this is where all static files will be stored.
1. You can name the bucket what you want, for simplicity I recommend the same name as your Heroku App.  
1. Select the region closest to you.
1. Right underneath uncheck the box that says Block public access, then check the box acknowledging the fact that the bucket will be public, you need to do this to allow public access to our static files.
1. Click create bucket, your bucket is now created
1. Click the bucket name
1. Click the Properties tab 
1. Select Static Web Hosting, this gives you a new endpoint we can use to access the files from the internet.
1. The index and error document are not relevant in this project so just fill in the default values. presented on the screen.
1. Click save.
1. Change bucket tab to the Permissions tab.
1. Go to CORS configuration and paste this code:

[
    {
      "AllowedHeaders": [
          "Authorization"
      ],
      "AllowedMethods": [
          "GET"
      ],
      "AllowedOrigins": [
          "*"
      ],
      "ExposeHeaders": []
  }
]

[Structure of code above](https://ibb.co/7vbwSNn)

1. Click save, this code is necessary for the connection between the Heroku App and the S3 bucket. 
1. Next, in the Permission tab pick the Bucket Policy option.
1. Click the Policy generator link.
1. Pick the S3 bucket policy type.
1. Leave the radio button on Allow and add a * as Principal.
1. Leave the AWS Service on Amazon S3.
1. Select the Action GetObject.
1. Copy the ARN which stands for Amazon resource name from the S3 tab (the other tab).
1. Paste it into the ARN box at the bottom of the form.
1. Click Add statement.
1. Click Generate policy.
1. Copy the policy into the bucket policy editor.
1. Before clicking Save add a slash star here: /* . You do this to allow access to all resources in this bucket.
1. Click Save.
1.  Next, in the Permission tab pick the Access Control List option.

#### IAM 
1. Go back to the services menu and search for IAM.
1. Start by creating a group.
1. On the IAM dashboard, under Access Management click Groups.
1. Click Create New Group button.
1. You can call the group whatever you want but I recommend, adding ‘manage-<your-product-name>’. 
1. Click next, then next again.
1. Click Create Group.
1. In the IAM dashboard under Access Management click Policies.
1. Click Create Policy.
1. Pick the JSON tab.
1. Click the link that says Import Managed Policy.
1. Search S3 in the search bar and pick AmazonS3FullAccess option. 
1. Copy the your web address and open a new tab and go back to the S3 view.
1. Click the name of your bucket in S3.
1. Go to the Permissions Tab and go to Bucket Policy.
1. Copy the ARN.
1. Go back to the AIM tab.
1. Paste the ARN in the JSON tab next to Resource. 
1. Add a comma. 
1. Then paste in the ARN again underneath the first ARN and add a /* after it, this takes care of 
all S3 actions allowed both on our bucket itself and on everything in it.
1. Click Review Policy
1. Give the policy a name, I suggest the name of your project and a ‘-policy’ at the end of it, 
and an optional description. 
1. Click create policy.
1. Click Group in the IAM dashboard. 
1. Click the name of your group.
1. Click Attach Policy.
1. Search for the policy you just created.
1. Check the box and click Attach Policy. 
1. Now click User in the IAM dashboard. 
1. Click Add User.
1. Create a name that makes sense, perhaps <project-name>-staticfiles-user.
1. Check the Programmatic Access in Access Type.
1. Click Next: Permissions.
1. Add user to group (which should be listed) by checking the box.
1. Click Next:Tags.
1. Click the next button.
1. Then finally click create user.
1. Click Download .csv: this contains both this users access key and secret access key.
1. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU DOWNLOAD THIS CSV BECAUSE AFTER THIS STEP YOU WILL NO LONGER HAVE 
ACCESS TO IT AND IT IS CRUCIAL FOR THE PROJECT TO AUTHENTICATE ITEMS TO THE DJANGO APP!
To review you have created a group, attached an access policy to it that allows full S3 access to your
 bucket and created a user that's part of the group and who has their own special access keys.

#### Adding AWS users key and secret key to Heroku
1. Go to Settings tab on Heroku.
1. Go to Config Vars.
1. Click Reveal Vars.
1. Add AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID to key and add your own users access key which you get the value from the 
CSV you opened earlier.
1.  Add AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY to key and add your own secret access key which you get the value from
 the CSV you opened earlier.
1. KEEP BOTH OF THESE VALUES SECRET!
1. Add the key USE_AWS to True so your settings file know that this is the database you are supposed
 to use when deploying to Heroku.
1. Lets set up automatic pushes from GitHub to Heroku.
1. Click the Enable Automatic Deploys button in the Automatic Deploys section of the page. 
1. Underneath the Automatic Deploys section in the Manual Deploy section click the Deploy Branch button. 
1. After clicking the  Deploy Branch button Heroku will start building the app from Github, when this 
is done (if there are not any issues) you will get a ‘Your app was successfully deployed!’ message with
 a button titled ‘View’ to view your app. 
1. Your app is now deployed successfully and whenever you push changes to GitHub Heroku will automatically
 update the app. 
1. After this go back to your Git workspace and commit and push the project 
1. If you look in the Heroku Activities section you can see this triggered an automatic deployment to Heroku.
1. The build is done you should be able to see that all the static files were collected successfully.
1.Go to S3 on AWS.
1. You should now be able to see a static folder in your bucket with all your static files in it
Last Heroku thing:
1. For the STRIPE_WH_SECRET go back to Stripe and repeat the same webhook url process as earlier but 
instead add the Heroku URL with the checkout/wh/ at the end.
1. Grab the Signing Secret in the same way as described above in the Stripe section, go back to Heroku 
and add  STRIPE_WH_SECRET with new Heroku value to Config Vars. 

#### Uploading Media Files to bucket
1. Download all images from the my workspace media folder onto your own computer.
1. Go to S3 on AWS.
1. In your bucket click Create folder.
1. Name the folder media and click Save.
1. Click the media folder.
1. Click Upload.
1. Click Add files.
1.Select all images and then click Open.
1. Then click Next.
1. Under Manage Public permissions pick Grant public read access to this object.
1. Click Next.
1. Click Next.
1. Click Upload.
 
After this you are finally all ready to go, you have everything set up correctly and can improve 
on my project! Happy coding!

### Acknowledgements

* For my FutureRetro project I had a very clear image of what I wanted to do from the very beginning 
in terms of style of the page and color story, I initially thought of the idea of a e-store with a 
modern secondhand feel a couple of months earlier when working on my third milestone project.  When 
I realized it wasn’t going to work for that project I decided to save the idea for my fourth 
milestone project instead. I wanted it to feel vintage without feeling old, keeping the colors 
mostly to black and white and the font inline with a typewriter font. When I started the last 
project I decided that I wanted to keep inline with the structure of the Boutique Ado project, 
following the videos one more time to give myself as much repetition time as possible before ending 
my course. My idea was as I assume many others to follow the videos and make creative changes along 
the way. By the time I got to the final stretch of my project I realised that all creative decisions 
I had made previously landed me in a place where it looks like I have just followed the Boutique Ado 
videos and made almost no changes to the actual code in terms of functionality and structure. I also 
realized that I had completely missed one of the main lessons of coding which was to code smart. My 
inability to code smart severely negatively impacted the time I had to put towards original ideas 
because by the time I was getting closer to my deadline I realized I had to scrap a lot of ideas on 
the basis of simply not having time. If I were to redo this project today I would have not spent so 
much time rewriting Boutique Ado code and instead writing everything from scratch I would have reused 
code that I knew wasn’t going to change that much like the checkout and profiles app. Properly 
crediting Code Institute of course! But this way being able to put more time and energy into original 
code and ideas.  I will take this lesson to heart and remember this on my next project!

* I want to say a huge thank you to my mentor Sandeep, his guidance has been crucial!
